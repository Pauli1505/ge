Hello, world!
this is the AGC, (AHK Game Creator), a simple program designed for game development on AHK (https://github.com/Libre-X-Projects/AHK-main)

to build:
make shaders
make
cd build
./GE (includes run)

The AGC is a simple engine made in OpenGL, SDL2, and C++, well, if you can call it a game engine.
